# 🚢 Titanic Kaggle Project  

The **Titanic Kaggle Project** is a beginner-friendly machine learning competition where participants build predictive models to determine passenger survival from the Titanic disaster. The dataset includes key features such as **age, sex, ticket class, fare, number of relatives aboard, and cabin information**.  

The primary goal is to analyze these features and develop a robust classification model that predicts survival outcomes (**0 = Did not survive, 1 = Survived**). This project is an excellent opportunity to practice:  
- 🔍 **Data Preprocessing**  
- ⚙️ **Feature Engineering**  
- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- 🤖 **Machine Learning Model Development & Evaluation**  

## 🚀 Performance Progress  
- 📉 **First Trial:** Ranked **12,000+**  
- 📈 **Third Trial:** Improved to **Top 1,800+**  

This significant improvement reflects continuous learning, optimization, and enhanced feature selection strategies. Further refinements aim to push the model toward even higher rankings.  

## 📌 Key Learnings & Next Steps  
✔️ Handling missing values efficiently  
✔️ Feature selection and engineering techniques  
✔️ Hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy  
✔️ Experimenting with advanced ML models (Ensemble methods, Deep Learning)  

Stay tuned for further progress! 🚀
