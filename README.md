# Titanic_Kaggle_Project
 
The **Titanic Kaggle Project** is a beginner-friendly machine learning competition where participants build predictive models to determine which passengers survived the Titanic disaster. The dataset includes passenger details such as **age, sex, ticket class, fare, number of relatives aboard, and cabin information**. The goal is to analyze these features and develop a classification model that predicts survival outcomes (0 = did not survive, 1 = survived). Itâ€™s an excellent project for learning data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning model evaluation.
